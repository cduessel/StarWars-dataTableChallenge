React contextApi+Hooks vs Redux - a Trybe Challenge

A challenge from Trybe School in which we had to make the "same" react app, once using contextApi and Hooks and another with redux.

The code is a little messy because we only had a couple of days to do it and it was my first time using REDUX...nevertheless it was FUN!
